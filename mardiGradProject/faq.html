    <details>
        <summary>Do I need tickets?</summary>
        <p>There is no need for tickets to see a parade...all of them are FREE!! That is why it is called "The
            Greatest Free Show
            on Earth!". You only get tickets if you want to sit down on stands as the parades pass.</p><br>
    </details><br>

    <details>
        <summary>Are Carnival and Mardi Gras the same thing?</summary>
        <p>Technically, "Carnival" refers to the period of feasting and fun that begins on January 6 (see
            question
            below) and ends
            on Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday), the final day of revelry before Ash Wednesday when Lent begins. It is
            also
            common for
            people to refer to the entire season as Mardi Gras and, for clarity, to call Fat Tuesday "Mardi Gras
            Day." Locals tend
            to call the season "Carnival" and, to us, the last two weekends leading up to Tuesday are"Mardi
            Gras."

    <details>
        <summary>What is Twelfth Night?</summary>
        <p>Twelfth Night (aka, Twelfth Night, the Feast of the Epiphany and Three Kings' Day) is celebrated on
            January 6th in New
            Orleans and is the official start of Mardi Gras every year. While the date of Fat Tuesday changes,
            Twelfth Night does
            not. According to Wikipedia, different traditions mark the date of Twelfth Night as either January 5
            or
            January 6 (it
            depends on whether they start counting the twelve days on December 25 or 26)</p><br>

    <details>
        <summary>When was the first Mardi Gras?</summary>
        <p> The first Mardi Gras parade was held in New Orleans on Feb. 24, 1857 by the Krewe of Comus. They
            began
            the
            tradition of
            presenting a parade with floats and following it with a ball for the krewe and their guests.</p><br>
    </details><br>

    <details>
        <summary>What is the significance of the Mardi Gras colors, and where did they come from?</summary>
        <p>Rex, the King of Carnival, selected the Mardi Gras colors and assigned meaning to them in 1892.
            Purple
            stands for
            justice, green for faith, and gold for power.</p><br>
    </details><br>

    <details>
        <summary>Why are masks worn?</summary>
        <p>By law, float riders must always have a mask on. On Fat Tuesday, masking is legal for everyone else,
            and
            the elaborate masks that some wear add to the fun.</p><br>
    </details><br>

    <details>
        <summary>How is a king chosen?</summary>
        <p>The method of selecting a king varies from krewe to krewe. Some krewes hold random drawings, while
            others
            invite a
            celebrity guest to be their king. Rex, the King of Carnival, is chosen by the School of Design, who
            sponsors the Rex
            parade. His identity is revealed the day before the parade.</p><br>
    </details><br>

    <details>
        <summary>How long have "throws" been around?</summary>

        <p>The tradition of float riders throwing trinkets to the crowds began in the 1870s, and continues
            today.
            Typical throws
            include beads, cups, doubloons and stuffed animals.</p><br>
    </details><br>

    <details>
        <summary>How does Mardi Gras benefit the New Orleans economy?</summary>

        <p>Economic impact reports indicate that Mardi Gras generates over $1 billion in annual spending.
        </p><br>
    </details><br>

    <details>
        <summary>How is the City government involved?</summary>

        <p>City governments are not involved in coordinating Mardi Gras parades. The governments issue parade
            permits, but that is
            the extent of their involvement. Krewes independently schedule and coordinate their own parades.
        </p><br>
    </details><br>

    <details>
        <summary>Who organizes and pays for Mardi Gras?</summary>
        <p>Mardi Gras parade krewes are private, non-profit organizations whose members get together year round
            to
            plan their
            parade's theme, costumes and unique throws. Each Carnival Club, as they are known, is individually
            funded by its
            members. They support their krewe through dues, sales of krewe-related merchandise to their members,
            and
            fundraising.
            Mardi Gras parade krewes sometimes have corporate sponsors.

            The city of New Orleans is not involved in coordinating Mardi Gras parades; their only involvement
            is to
            issue parade
            permits to each individual Mardi Gras krewe that schedules and coordinates its own parade.</p>

        <summary>Who first broadcast Mardi Gras LIVE on the Internet?</summary>
        <p>MardiGrasNewOrleans.com, of course. We organized and presented the first live Mardi Gras in 1995 and
            continued sharing
            this with our visitors for several years with companies like Microsoft and REAL Media. The live
            events
            showcased on
            MardiGrasNewOrleans.com have been covered by the New York Times, Chicago Tribune, Times Picayune,
            Morning Advocate, San
            Diego Union Tribune, Texas Monthly, and the Discovery Channel among others.

            The first year, we presented the Orpheuscapade, and soon offered live chats with celebrities,
            interviews
            with costumed
            revelers on the streets, and video from atop hotels in the Garden District.</p><br>
