            <h1>Mardi Gras in New Orleans</h1><br>
            <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                Celebrations are
                concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the
                start of lent in
                the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many
                days have
                several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
                Gras season. In
                the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades
                and balls (some
                of them masquerade balls).</p><br>
            <img src="images/30.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
                schedule and route
                each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the
                Knights of Momus and
                the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events
                (often featuring
                celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social Aid &
                Pleasure Clubâ€”a
                predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most
                common throws are
                strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small
                inexpensive toys.
                Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year. <br><br>

                While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate
                in the Uptown and
                Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of
                the French
                Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in
                the Faubourg
                Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras Day. Mardi Gras Day traditionally
                concludes with the
                "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.</p>

            <p></p><br>
            <img src="images/history.jpg" alt="">
            <p>The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River in
                what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men
                celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the
                festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and
                dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing).[2] An account from 1743 that the custom of
                Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on Mardi Gras
                took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions
                were lifted or enforcement waned. <br><br>


                The Carnival at New Orleans, 1885
                In 1833, Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent raised money
                to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration. James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other
                Miscellaneous Pieces describes New Orleans Mardi Gras in 1835: <br><br>

                Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun,
                frolic, and comic masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active
                operation. Men and boys, women and girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert
                themselves to invent and appear in grotesque, quizzical, diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and
                disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and birds, beasts and birds with human heads;
                demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from the moon; mermaids;
                satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts, coaches,
                cars, &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming,
                fiddling, fifeing, and all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way. <br><br>

                In 1856, 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to
                observe Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mistick
                Krewe of Comus. According to one historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what
                New Orleans had always considered a French festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than
                this parade that the lead in the holiday had passed from French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a
                certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its Creoles. To a certain extent, New Orleans
                'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of how their business prowess
                helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized Carnival
                passed from Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the course of the
                nineteenth century. The spectacle of Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to
                compete with Creoles in the ballrooms and on the streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans
                culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely American." <br><br>

                In 1875, Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday. War, economic, political, and weather
                conditions sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American
                Civil War, World War I and World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival. <br>

                The 1898, Rex parade, with the theme of "Harvest Queens," was filmed by the American Mutoscope Co.
                The rumored but long-lost recording was rediscovered in 2022. The two-minute film records 6 parade
                floats, including one transporting a live ox.</p>

            <h2>Epiphany</h2><br>

            <p>Epiphany on January 6, has been recognized as the start of the New Orleans Carnival season since at least
                1900; locally,
                it is sometimes known as Twelfth Night although this term properly refers to Epiphany Eve, January 5,
                the evening of the
                twelfth day of Christmastide.The Twelfth Night Revelers, New Orleans' second-oldest Krewe, have
                staged a parade and
                masked ball on this date since 1870.A number of other groups such as the Phunny Phorty Phellows, La
                SociÃ©tÃ© Pas Si
                SecrÃ¨te Des Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es and the Krewe de Jeanne D'Arc have more recently begun to stage events on
                Epiphany as
                well. <br>

                Many of Carnival's oldest societies, such as the Independent Strikers' Society, hold masked balls but no
                longer parade
                in public. <br>

                Mardi Gras season continues through Shrove Tuesday or Fat Tuesday.</p><br>

            <h2>Days leading up to Mardi Gras Day</h2><br>

            <p>The population of New Orleans more than doubles during the five days before Mardi Gras Day, in
                anticipation of the
                biggest celebration. <br>

                Wednesday night begins with Druids, and is followed by the Mystic Krewe of Nyx, the newest all-female
                Krewe. Nyx is
                famous for their highly decorated purses, and has reached Super Krewe status since their founding in
                2011. Nyx has
                plummeted in membership and can no longer hold their self proclaimed status as a super krewe. <br>

                Thursday night starts off with another all-women's parade featuring the Krewe of Muses. The parade is
                relatively new,
                but its membership has tripled since its start in 2001. It is popular for its throws (highly
                sought-after decorated
                shoes and other trinkets) and themes poking fun at politicians and celebrities. <br>

                Friday night is the occasion of the large Krewe of Hermes and satirical Krewe D'Ã‰tat parades, ending
                with one of the
                fastest-growing krewes, the Krewe of Morpheus.There are several smaller neighborhood parades like
                the Krewe of
                Barkus and the Krewe of OAK. <br>

                Several daytime parades roll on Saturday (including Krewe of Tucks and Krewe of Isis) and on Sunday
                (Thoth, Okeanos, and
                Krewe of Mid-City). <br>

                The first of the "super krewes," Endymion, parades on Saturday night, with the celebrity-led Bacchus
                parade on Sunday
                night.</p><br>

            <h2>Mardi Gras Day</h2><br>

            <p>The celebrations begin early on Mardi Gras Day, which can fall on any Tuesday between February 3 and
                March 9 (depending
                on the date of Easter, and thus of Ash Wednesday). <br>

                In New Orleans, the Zulu parade rolls first, starting at 8 am on the corner of Jackson and Claiborne and
                ending at Broad
                and Orleans, Rex follows Zulu as it turns onto St. Charles following the traditional Uptown route from
                Napoleon to St.
                Charles and then to Canal St. Truck parades follow Rex and often have hundreds of floats blowing loud
                horns, with entire
                families riding and throwing much more than just the traditional beads and doubloons. Numerous smaller
                parades and
                walking clubs also parade around the city. The Jefferson City Buzzards, the Lyons Club, the Irish
                Channel Corner Club,
                Pete Fountain's Half Fast Walking Club and the KOE all start early in the day Uptown and make their way
                to the French
                Quarter with at least one jazz band. At the other end of the old city, the Society of Saint Anne
                journeys from the
                Bywater through Marigny and the French Quarter to meet Rex on Canal Street. The Pair-O-Dice Tumblers
                rambles from bar to
                bar in Marigny and the French Quarter from noon to dusk. Various groups of Mardi Gras Indians, divided
                into uptown and
                downtown tribes, parade in their finery. <br>
